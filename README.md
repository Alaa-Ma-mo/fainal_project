Capstone Project | Web Automation Final Project.

This project focuses on automating web testing for a magento  web application using Selenium and TestNG in Java. The goal is to ensure the quality and reliability of the web application through automated test scripts that simulate real-world user interactions. This project aims to demonstrate the ability to perform effective test automation while improving testing efficiency.
Technologies Used:

Selenium: An open-source tool for automating web browsers. It is used to perform automated testing on the web application.
TestNG: A testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit, designed to support test configuration, grouping, parameterization, and parallel execution.

Java: The programming language used to write the test scripts and implement the test automation logic.

Features:

Test Reporting: TestNG provides detailed test reports with pass/fail status and execution logs to help analyze test results.
Test Data Management: Test scripts can be parameterized to test various input data combinations.

Parallel Test Execution: Tests are executed in parallel to optimize the execution time.
